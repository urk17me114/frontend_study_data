        <p>In HTML, you can add comments to explain parts of your code, make notes, or temporarily disable sections without deleting them.<br> Comments are ignored by the browser and do not appear on the webpage. You initialized your local folder, made your first commit, and now want it to appear on GitHub’s main branch.<br> These two commands make sure:

        <hr>✔ The branch name is <b>correct</b> and <i>standardized</i> <!-- <b> for bold and <i> for italics-->
        ✔ <big>GitHub</big> knows where your local branch <small>should</small> sync with <!-- <br> break to go to next line and <hr> to give a horizontal line-->
        

        After this, you can simply use git push or git pull without needing extra parameters.

        Let me know if you want examples or help with pushing for the first time!</p><hr>
