%-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this chapter, the implementation of \wotsp, as well as the desktop and ESP32 versions of the Dancing Bear signature scheme, are briefly summarized and explained.
Detailed annotations to the code are provided as comments directly in the source files and are therefore not discussed in this chapter.
Instead, the general concepts and design choices are highlighted and discussed.
