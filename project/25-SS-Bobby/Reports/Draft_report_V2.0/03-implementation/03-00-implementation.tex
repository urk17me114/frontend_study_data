In this chapter, the implementation of the Django-based School Management System is briefly summarized and explained. 
Detailed annotations to the code are provided as comments directly in the source files and are therefore not repeated here. 
Instead, the general concepts, design choices, and module-level implementations are highlighted and discussed.
