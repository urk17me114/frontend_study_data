Last meeting  we discussed on the things expected for version 2 of the bobby tables project.

The suggestions included:
Improvement on the current code quality and documentation
More vulnerabilities to be implemented (expected a total of 15 attacks including the ones already implemented)
Since most of the vulnerabilities implemented are based on the HTTP request manipulation, the ones yet to be implemented should be diverse from those existing ones...
Implement the bobby table attack which is in the comic.
Proper error handling need to be done other than the default Django error page that loads in case of error
A visible que for the user to know about the vulnerability. For example if  the DB is dropped as a part of the attack then the user should see the timetable has gone blank...
One additional configuration needs to be done by splitting the vulnerabilities / Containerisation (like using a docker) needs to be done.


Things to do for the next meeting:
 A detailed summary of the roadmap for version 2 needs to be done which states what every team member will do from July 24 to aug 25th .
